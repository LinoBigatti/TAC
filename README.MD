# Tool Assisted Charting

The TAC repo consists of a series of unofficial scripts for the Project Heartbeat editor. Feel free to use them and give feedback on the issues tab or in discord. The current scripts are:

- Spiral arrangers
- 360 and double 360 pattern generators
- Alternating pattern generators
- Sine arrangers
- Opposite note converters
- Note quantizers
- Fall Type (GH-like) arrangers

Note: These scripts are working on the Beta Editor (the New Editor). If you are still using the Stable Editor, they might not work.
